test cases:


balance = 3329            #Say you have a debt of $3329
annualInterestRate = 0.2  #Credit card company charges 20% annual interest on the balance

Lowest Payment: 310       #This is the amount you need to pay every month for 1 year to pay off the balance




balance = 4773
annualInterestRate = 0.2

Lowest Payment: 440




balance = 3926
annualInterestRate = 0.2

Lowest Payment: 360
